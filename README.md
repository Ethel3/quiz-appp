## About the Project
This is an online Quiz Application. It gives users multiple choice questions to select an answer. 
The questions are answered in a linear form, hence you can't navigate to the previous question. It automatically moves to next question once user selects an answer.

## My Personal Experience about this project
I started this Quiz Application with my own coded questions, until I was taught how to use the web API from the open trivia questions to complete this Quiz Application.
